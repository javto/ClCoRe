We have developed a new image processing client/server application, which would allow users to upload set of images and receive them back resized to 4 different sizes. To do this, we made use of the Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing t2.micro instances which are their smallest and free instances. The system provisions new machines when the load is high, stops them when the load is low and puts jobs on the machines with the lowest load.
%TODO: add analysis overview and main result
