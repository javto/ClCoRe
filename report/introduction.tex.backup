\paragraph{Current Situation} 
BV wants to develop a new image processing client/server application, which would allow users to upload set of images and receive them back resized to 4 different sizes. Such application might be useful e.g. for web galleries, which require to have images in different sizes to show image previews etc. WantCloud BV wants to try the cloud computing approach for this application to allow the scaling of the application.

\paragraph{Related Work} 
Amazon EC2 t2.micro instances were chosen to host the desired image processing application. The application itself is developed in JAVA and is using several external libraries to support its functions. JCommander library was used to allow users to specify custom parameters for resized images.
