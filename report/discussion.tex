%Discussion (recommended size: 1 page): summarize the main findings of your work
%and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in the design of cloud-computing-based applications.
%Should the WantCloud CTO use IaaS-based clouds? Among others, use extrapolation
%on the results, as reported in Section 6.b of the report, to discuss the charged time and
%charged cost reported in section for 100,000/1,000,000/10,000,000 users and for 1
%day/1 month/1 year.
The slave application as it is written at the time of handing in this report uses the processor of the t2.micro instances for the full 100\%. This means that load balancing and provisioning of new machines have no real effect at the moment. What it does at the moment is refer jobs to a random machine and use all the machines it can possibly start because of the elasticity module. Sadly we came across this fact during the experiments and had no time to rewrite the system to use interrupts instead of the current method.\\
If we did not use the free instances and used paid instances instead, this would have been a costly mistake. The problem of using IaaS-based clouds is that it is very attractive to build and test there right away. But, if we would use the free instances, we can first thoroughly experiment and test our application before running it on the paid cloud and save money this way.\\
The results show that the waiting time for clients to get there resized images back goes up with the number of users that are simultaneously connecting. The time a user would have to wait if a 100 other users are connecting at the same time with the current system would be around nineteen minutes costing 3 euro, for 1000 users this would be more than two hours, costing a total of 200 Euro. With more testing time we could see what the effect is of better provisioning and load balancing with interrupts, in order to reduce these numbers.\\
We recommend that we spend more time on rewriting the application to make better use of the resources and proceed to use the cloud with caution, so only deploy an application there after it has been thoroughly tested.
